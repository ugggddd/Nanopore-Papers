## Abstract

With the development of Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT), various supporting signal processing and biological information processing tools have also emerged rapidly. Among them, **[basecaller](#basecaller)** and **[simulation](#simulator)** are two key research directions. There is a good Chinese review on this subject here **纳米孔测序信号处理及其在DNA数据存储的应用(2021)**[[PDF]](https://github.com/ugggddd/Nanopore-Papers/blob/master/Review/%E7%BA%B3%E7%B1%B3%E5%AD%94%E6%B5%8B%E5%BA%8F%E4%BF%A1%E5%8F%B7%E5%A4%84%E7%90%86%E5%8F%8A%E5%85%B6%E5%9C%A8DNA%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%AD%98%E5%82%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8.pdf).
